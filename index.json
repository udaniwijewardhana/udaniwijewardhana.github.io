In the absence of thorough survey data, this study assessed which species benefit most from conservation areas using citizen science bird counts extracted from the Atlas of Living Australia.

The trends for six resident shorebird species were compared to those for the Australian Pied Oystercatcher, with the Black-fronted Dotterel, Red-capped Dotterel, and Red-kneed Dotterel exhibiting significantly steeper increasing trends. For the Black-fronted Dotterel, Masked Lapwing, and Red-kneed Dotterel, steeper rising trends were recorded in conservation areas than in other locations. The Dotterel species’ conservation status is extremely favourable.

When a bird species is lost, the benefits it might have afforded are gone forever. Population of many Australian birds are declining mainly because of habitat loss. Australia regularly supports 54 shorebird species and 17 of these species spend their entire life within Australia. We call these local Australian shorebirds including the Hooded Plover, Sooty Oystercatcher, Banded Lapwing and Masked Lapwing. Rapid decline in local shorebird numbers has been observed in the last three decades.\nThere are no robust indicators of biodiversity conservation that can be used to complement existing national indicators of economic and social health. My research addresses this important issue while developing a novel and reliable measure of persistence to identify threatened bird species worldwide. I hope that my research findings will help to create more effective and efficient responses for conservation of threatened bird species worldwide. Citizen science involves volunteers who participate in scientific research by collecting data, monitoring sites, and even taking part in the whole process of scientific inquiry. Citizen science can directly contribute to biogeographical knowledge and conservation policies by increasing the number of recorded species in large geographic areas. Citizen becoming a cost-effective alternative for acquiring high-resolution data and information. Therefore, I am using citizen science data for my research.\nMy research demonstrates the need for understanding the effects of climate and protection of geographical areas on local shorebirds. It also demonstrates the need for understanding the interactions between local shorebirds and predators such as red foxes and cats for conservation purposes. Since researchers are saying that climate change is responsible for a substantial decline in shorebird populations, I have explored the effects of climate for local shorebirds in Australia. I have also explored the effects of protected areas for local shorebirds. These areas are key to biodiversity preservation, achieving good conservation returns.\nThis works suggests that statistical models developed with citizen science data can be used for monitoring the persistence of local shorebirds and for investigating factors that are impacting these data.

There are no robust indicators of biodiversity conservation that can be used to complement existing national indicators of economic and social health. The statistical methods which are used to model and evaluate the persistence or extinction risk of threatened bird species using citizen science data are reviewed in this study. Citizen science data helps to increase the number of records, thereby improving our understanding of the dynamics in declining bird species populations. Adhering to the PRISMA guidelines a comprehensive systematic review was performed using three databases such as; ProQuest Central, Scopus and Web of Science from January 1900 to January 2019. Only journal articles which analysed the persistence or extinction risk of threatened bird species using a statistical model, predictive model or a trend analysis, developed using citizen science data were included in this study. Bird species in near threatened or least concern categories that are declining in population or range were also included, since these may be the next wave of species to be added to the endangered species lists. Most of the 39 unique studies describing statistical models for this purposeused generalized linear models, followed by hierarchical or linear mixed models, machine learning models and persistence probability models respectively. A quality assessment tool was created in order to evaluate these articles. The review suggested several methods for measuring the persistence of threatened bird species, but there was no attempt to identify critical tipping points using methods such as changepoint analysis. The findings suggest that the persistence of threatened bird species varies depending on various risk factors which need to be addressed in order to produce better outcomes for the conservation of threatened birds. This review reveals the most suitable statistical methods for this purpose.","tags":null,"title":"Statistical models for the persistence of threatened birds using citizen science data: A Systematic Review","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Udani Wijewardhana","Denny Meyer","Madawa Jayawardana"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1570015800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1570015800,"objectID":"8d5f14af6ba5714bb48b6087469b29ce","permalink":"https://udaniwijewardhana.github.io/talk/2019/","publishdate":"2019-10-02T11:30:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019/","section":"talk","summary":"The BirdLife International assessed in 2015, that 13% of bird species are threatened with extinction and extinction of many bird species has become a theme too frequently occurring around the world. Determining whether a bird species has become extinct or extant has become a difficulty exercise due to survey efforts being too costly and sighting data limited. This is especially affecting threatened birds. However, because of citizen science data, the number of sightings has increased over the years (number of sightings in eBird database increased more than 20 million from 2012 to 2018).\nThe Hooded Plover is listed as a vulnerable bird species under IUCN red list assessment criteria. In this study we compared three different models to identify the effect of climate on extinction risk for the Hooded Plover in Mornington Peninsula in both temporal and spatial-temporal scales, which is a prerequisite for developing effective strategies to conserve them while identifying the factors effect for their persistence like climate change. In order to identify the climate change and citizen science effect for the persistence of Hooded Plover using citizen science data available from eBird which has a large amount of validated observational data for birds. The Hooded Plover is a non-migratory local bird in Australia, so we considered monthly data for our study. Initially probability of persistence models was used as a reference for determining the significant factors. It is useful to know if a forecast model provides better results than any reference model. Then, to identify the climate effect, we consider the mean monthly temperature, and total monthly rainfall on the Mornington Peninsula. To control for the growth in citizen science data, we consider the human population on the Mornington Peninsula.\nThe citizen science count data often include excess zeros for rare species like Hooded Plover in specific areas or time periods. Therefore, we compared zero-inflated hurdle models and zero inflated models using Poisson and Negative Binomial distributions and discuss extensions of these models while using count data in temporal and spatial-temporal structures to deal with those excess zeros. In both the temporal and spatial-temporal models the performance of the Negative Binomial distribution was superior while overcoming over-dispersion issue. Similar conclusions can be drawn from both temporal and spatial-temporal models. Temperature has a significant positive effect on the non-zero counts (i.e. higher counts of Hooded Plover are associated with higher temperature). Growth in citizen science effort, linked to population growth, explained the lower probability of a zero count.\nThis work shows that statistical models can be used to address the challenges associated with the use of citizen science data for monitoring the persistence of rare birds, while identifying factors affecting this persistence such as climate.","tags":[],"title":"Statistical models for the persistence of Hooded Plover on Mornington Peninsula using citizen science data","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Udani Abhisheka Wijewardhana","Chinthaka Bandara","Thesath Nanayakkara"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538956800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538956800,"objectID":"71c6436fdc0e645c25a540be83227871","permalink":"https://udaniwijewardhana.github.io/publication/debt/","publishdate":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/debt/","section":"publication","summary":"Debt collection is a massive industry, within the USA alone more than $50 billion recovered each year.

An ecoregion is the only unit that is small enough to be noticeable but large enough to be significant. An ecoregion encompasses a larger physical area than an ecosystem or habitat and it may contain hundreds of ecosystems and several habitats. Ecoregions are significant to conservationists because they contain places with critical ecological and evolutionary processes and circumstances. Although tropical rainforests and coral reefs harbour the most biodiversity, unique manifestations of nature can be found in all other ecoregions, which may be lost forever if they are not safeguarded and conserved. In this study we have analysed the effect of ecoregions for resident shorebirds in Australia in the context of local migration. In this study we considered count data for Masked Lapwing, Banded Stilt, Black-winged Stilt, Red-capped Dotterel, Red-kneed Dotterel and Red-necked Avocet, taken from Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) for the years 2000 to 2018 at a seasonal level across the whole of Australia. We have fitted spatio-temporal models with besagproper latent models in INLA, taking ecoregions of each bioregion, season and trend into account.\nThe first set of models considers only main effects for trend, season and ecoregion, finding significant variation in counts across the seasons for all the species. However, significant differences in counts across the seven ecoregions were only found for the Black-winged Stilt, the Masked Lapwing and Red-Capped Dotterel. A significant upward trend in the counts for Masked Lapwing and Red-Capped Dotterel was also identified. The second set of models consider seasonal migration across ecoregions while controlling for trend, finding significant seasonal migration for all the species. The final set of models considered changes in the ecoregion distribution across the years while controlling for seasonal migration. This model suggested a decreasing trend for Banded-Stilt with no significant differences in this trend across the ecoregions. For all the other regions there were significant differences in trend across the ecoregions.\nPossible biases in the citizen science data used in this study is one limitation of this study. In addition, our models are intended to describe only long-term trends in seasonal migration, and they do not allow for the sporadic flooding of wetlands in particular years. It is expected that wetland bird counts are under-estimated in these years because it is hard to reach these areas due to flooded roads. Also, the length of the series used in this analysis is too short to allow for El Nino cycles. Future models should attempt to take this into consideration while also investigating the reasons for increasing counts in some ecoregions and decreasing counts in other ecoregions.\nAs a follow-up to this study, examined the effects of ecoregions on biodiversity over time (with the same six inland resident shorebirds) using spatiotemporal models.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b6e398c2150aa6495afdb7519d8ad057","permalink":"https://udaniwijewardhana.github.io/project/eco/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/eco/","section":"project","summary":"Study 4","tags":["PhD"],"title":"Effect of ecoregions for Australian resident shorebirds in the context of seasonal migration using citizen science data","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Conservation areas are a key strategy for preserving biodiversity, but few citizen science studies have evaluated the effectiveness of this strategy.

To achieve this, we considered three conditions such as size of the item requested by the vendors, the weather conditions of the local roads and the distance between the hubs and the vendors.The Lunar Clothing problem is one of the complex situations in shortest path Algorithm. This study is about the usage of traveling salesman algorithm for real world scenario. The entire problem has been decomposed to four major tasks such as dispatching the truck from main store to provincial hubs, assigning vendors for six stores in each provincial hub, transporting clothes from provincial hubs to vendors and dispatching ships to foreign ports. Then each and every task was analyzed and solved by using relevant algorithm. For mathematical modeling part and to generate the solution, Lingo software has been used. Some assumptions have been done in tasks for simplification. Then the optimal distribution schedule for Lunar Clothing has been implemented for processes in both inside and outside the country.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"24594f4c219e3ed01180c2fe008df180","permalink":"https://udaniwijewardhana.github.io/project/opti/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/opti/","section":"project","summary":"Modelling week research","tags":["honours"],"title":"Optimal Distribution Schedule for Lunar Clothing Manufacturing Company in Sri Lanka","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"9e8932dba4c3478ac98d9af3587dbeeb","permalink":"https://udaniwijewardhana.github.io/software/ppmca/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/software/ppmca/","section":"software","summary":"Users can use this app to identify the significant explanatory variables and the trends of the species during a span of years. The app would use truncated count models with log linear regression and zero inflation probability models with logistic regression. This app enables users to identify the significant changes in abundance level using Bayesian changepoint methods. Species persistence models in both spatial and temporal scales are used to identify the significant predictors for species count data while considering zero inflation models and detect significant changes in species abundance level using changepoint analysis.

When a fixed domain is partitioned into a finite number of subregions from which results are aggregated, areal or lattice data are produced. The Besag-York-Mollié (BYM) model, besag, besagproper, and BYM2 (Besag, York, and Mollié, 1991) have taken into account that data may be spatially correlated and observations in neighbouring areas may be more comparable than observations in areas further away. This model incorporates a spatial random effect that smooths the data based on a neighbourhood structure, as well as an unstructured exchangeable component that mimics uncorrelated noise. Spatio-temporal models that account not only for spatial structure but also for temporal correlations and spatio-temporal interactions are utilised in spatio-temporal contexts where species counts are monitored throughout time. We determined the mean expected value of the counts for each fitted model (with 95% credible intervals).
